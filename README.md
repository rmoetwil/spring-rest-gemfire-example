# spring-rest-gemfire-example
This is a simple example of using Spring Boot, Web and Gemfire Data to demonstrate a distributed (in-memory) datastore.

## Running the application
Run the application via your IDE or by using gradle bootRun.

The application exposes two endpoints:
- GET counter, get the current values of the counter object
- PUT counter, increment the counter object with 1


## Demo the following

1. Using REST and Gemfire to create a persistence store.
2. Using REST and Gemfire to create a distributed persistence store.
3. Replication of persistence store when new service instances are added. (and others are stopped)

ad.1
